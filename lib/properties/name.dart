/// Structured name.
///
/// Name structure varies widely by country. See:
/// https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_name#Structure
///
/// Data models such as those from Android and iOS are typically US-centric and
/// include middle name, prefix, suffix, etc. They also always include a
/// formatted displayed, which we recommend to use instead. That said, other
/// fields are included for compatibility, except for first and last names which
/// are common in most countries.
///
/// Since display name is always part of the top-level contact, it's not
/// included here.
///
/// Note that Android allows multiple names, while iOS allows only one. However
/// use cases for multiple names are debatable, especially since there is no
/// notion of "primary" name even on Android, and it is very common to see
/// multiple identical instances of the same name for the same contact. For all
/// those reasons, we only support one name per contact.
///
/// Note also that on iOS, nickname is included in the name fields (and again
/// only one is allowed), while on Android nickname is a separate data model and
/// one contact can have multiple nicknames, independent of their names. They
/// can also have distinct labels to indicate what type of nickname they are
/// (maiden name, short name, initials, default, other or any custom label). To
/// simplify, we only consider nickname as just another name field, and
/// disregard nickname labels.
